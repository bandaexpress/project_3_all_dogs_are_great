# project_3_all_dogs_are_great
Project 3 from Columbia University Data Analytics Bootcamp

# Authors:
Anthony Banda, Daniel Kenet, Emily Sims, and Jarret Baum. 

# Project Background:
Using The Dog Api (https://www.thedogapi.com/), our team created visualizations displaying various characteristics on over 200 dog breeds. Users can select any of those 200+ breed options on the dropdown menu, which will create a radar chart based on the selected breed. The radar chart shows where the dog breed ranks on a 0-10 scale (0 being the lowest, 10 being the hihest) based on height, weight, and life span characteristics.

We created a bar chart illustrating the most dominant dog traits among the 200+ breeds in the dataset.

Next, our page displays a scatter plot charting where each breed lies according height and weight. When you hover over a circle, it displays the breed name(s) that the data point represents.

Finally, our group created a temperment filter. Users can select two traits, from a dropdown listing all the temperament attributes in the dataset, and it will return what breeds have both those attributes.
